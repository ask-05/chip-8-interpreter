# CHIP-8 Emulator (In Progress)

A basic CHIP-8 Emulator designed in C++ and SDL3.



## Download Instructions

Download the **SDL3** development libraries and set its path in your project settings. Make sure to move the SDL3.lib file to the src folder as well.

Clone the repo and run main.cpp. This will automatically run the IBM program.

Instructions for building this project will be available once a Basic Version has been developed.

## Things left to do

- FX07, FX15, FX18, FX1E, FX29, FX33, FX55 and FX65
- Refactor code to create main CHIP-8 Class and header file
- Run code at 500 to 700 Hz instead of while(1) function
